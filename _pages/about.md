### -about me

Hi, I'm Raymond House, a current third-year at ![UCI Logo](assets/img/uci_logo.png)[University of California, Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu/), and I am working towards my BSc in Software Engineering. I'm currently an undergraduate reseacher at the [School of Medicine](https://medschool.uci.edu/) as well as a back-end software engineer intern at [NeuroLeap](https://neuroleap.com/). 

During my research, I primarily worked with ![Java Logo](assets/img/java_icon.png)Java and ![Kotlin Logo](assets/img/kotlin_icon.png)Kotlin to contribute to the development of a CNN-based android app designed to assist Glaucoma patients identify medicine bottle labels and expiration dates, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ken Lin](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6458). 

As a back-end web developer at NeuroLeap, I designed multiple methods to handle a variety of essential API endpoints, such as user registration and email transaction processing, using ![Go Logo](assets/img/Go_logo.png)Golang for server-side logic and ![Vue Logo](assets/img/Vue_logo.png)Vue.js for front-end interactions.



### -research interests

I am very passionate about the intersection between ðŸ’»computer science and ðŸ§¬biotechnology, and I'm hoping to get involved in related bioinformatics research positions during Spring/Summer of 2024. 

Lately I have been learning genome and protein analysis techniques, developing an [RNA-sequencing visualization toolkit](https://github.com/00raymond/visRNAseq) for FASTQ files and recording some of my [Rosalind solutions](https://github.com/00raymond/my-rosalind-solutions) on github.



### -hobbies

As a California Bay Area native, I love spending time on the beach either surfing or playing spikeball. During summer vacations, I enjoy water sports such as kayaking and paddleboarding in lakes at nearby mountains.
